      p.pad-top Summer is a fantastic time for kids to uncover new talents and interests. They have the time and freedom to go beyond the structure of school and become co-creators of other kinds of knowledge.
      p.pad-top-light At Power Up Tech Academy's summer camps, kids experience the empowerment of making exciting projects with technology. They are the designers, inventors and directors of unique games and apps. They learn how computers work by making them work. They gain their own special superpower: CODING.

          A fun and interactive class that will result in working animations created by your child!
          Learn coding basics while creating stories on the iPad.
          Play fun unplugged and iPad games that teach logic and sequential thinking.
          This class is suitable for all levels of readers and reinforces literacy skills.
        p Note: IPads are provided, but if you want to keep your work, please bring your own iPad, as files are saved locally on each device.

        p.class-description Discover the thrill of creating your own entertainment! Using Scratch, a kid-friendly programming language from MIT, kids can build space invaders, a virtual pet, geometry dash or any other kind of game they can imagine. Game programming develops skills such as logic, visual design, animation, sound design, storylines and more. It's a great way to take on new challenges while having lots of fun!
        p For kids who want something different than video games, we have a set of projects that focus on art, music and storytelling available too!
        p Beginners will be given guided projects to learn to code starting from basics, while experienced coders can select their own projects (and we will help with ideas, if needed!) and work on stretching and improving their coding skills with challenges, coaching and mentorship provided by our teachers.

          | ! The multi-sport program is designed to introduce athletes to a variety of different sports including Basketball, Baseball, Football, Capture the Flag and Dodgeball in one fun-filled week. Athletes will learn the rules and essentials of each sport through skill-based games and scrimmages. By the end of the week, your child will walk away with knowledge of multiple sports along with vital life lessons such as respect, teamwork, and self-discipline.

        p Learn to code by modifying one of today's most popular games! In this class, we use exploding chickens, drones that build houses for you, pumpkins that drop random lucky items, and more cool projects to learn about how programming works. Scratch experience is recommended and a Minecraft account is required (PC/Mac version, available from minecraft.net). 
        p Note: This is not a class to play Minecraft, so please set your child's expectations accordingly.

        p Work on your coding skills or learn something new in a workshop environment centered around your coding level and interests. Our teachers will help you to explore a language of your choice (we recommend Scratch, App Inventor, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Python), and start building apps, games and projects with it. With a low student-teacher ratio, this is a great setting for kids who know what they want to code but would like mentorship and guidance while doing it. All levels, including beginners, welcome.
