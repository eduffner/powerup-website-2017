            p.class-description.
              A fun and interactive class that will result in working animations created by your child!
              Learn coding basics while creating stories on the iPad.
              Play fun unplugged and iPad games that teach logic and sequential thinking.
              This class is suitable for all levels of readers and reinforces literacy skills.
            p Note: IPads are provided, but if you want to keep your work, please bring your own iPad, as files are saved locally on each device.

          h4.class-title.pad-top.heading-primary Coding Your Own Video Games and More
          h5.class-subtitle Grades 2-6, Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced
          .block.block-xlight
            p.class-description Discover the thrill of creating your own entertainment! Using Scratch, a kid-friendly programming language from MIT, kids can build space invaders, a virtual pet, geometry dash or any other kind of game they can imagine. Game programming develops skills such as logic, visual design, animation, sound design, storylines and more. It's a great way to take on new challenges while having lots of fun!
            p For kids who want something different than video games, we have a set of projects that focus on art, music and storytelling available too!
            p Beginners will be given guided projects to learn to code starting from basics, while experienced coders can select their own projects (and we will help with ideas, if needed!) and work on stretching and improving their coding skills with challenges, coaching and mentorship provided by our teachers.

          .block.block-xlight
            p Learn to code by modifying one of today's most popular games! In this class, we use exploding chickens, drones that build houses for you, pumpkins that drop random lucky items, and more cool projects to learn about how programming works. Scratch experience is recommended and a Minecraft account is required (PC/Mac version, available on Minecraft.net). 
            p Note: This is not a class to play Minecraft, so please set your child's expectations accordingly.

          h5.class-subtitle Grades 5-8, Beginner/Intermediate
          .block.block-xlight
            p Learn the languages of the internet: HTML, CSS and Javascript. Students will build a website on a topic of their choice and learn to add text, headings, links, images and embedded content such as videos. We will add interactive elements, and also cover styling tools to make your pages look fabulous!
   
            p This class will focus on "raw" HTML, CSS and Javascript. The Bootstrap grid and components will be introduced.
          
          h4.class-title.pad-top.heading-primary Start Text-Based Coding with Python
          h5.class-subtitle Grades 5-8, Beginner/Intermediate

            p If you are fluent in Scratch and want to move to the next level in coding with a text-based programming language, this is the class for you! We will introduce Python commands with comparisons to Scratch, so you can easily transfer your knowledge.
   
            p Projects will include console (text-based) games and apps, as well as building games using Pygame.
