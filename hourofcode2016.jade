      p.pad-top-light Each year, the first week of December is Computer Science Education Week, and the signature event is Hour of Code. The idea is to encourage all kids to do something related to coding for one hour so that they can discover or continue learning about the power and fun of computing.

      p At Power Up Tech Academy, we participate in Hour of Code by offering free workshops for both our students and members ofÂ the local community.

      p Plus, this year, we are offering a new PARENTS ONLY coding workshop - where you will participate in making a video game with Scratch just like the kids do!

      p The workshops are all free, but since our space is very limited we require pre-registration.

      p Here is the schedule for this year's workshops:
