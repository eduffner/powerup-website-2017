        h2.heading-section.text-center SUMMER 2017 KIDS CODING CAMPS <br>DAILY SCHEDULE
        p Every day at a Power Up summer camp provides a balanced mix of fun, educational, indoor and outdoor activities. 
        h2.heading-section.text-center.pad-top HALF DAY CAMPS
        p.text-center Our basic schedule for a 3 hour, half-day camp is simple:

            h4.pad-top Hour 1: CODING
            p Each day starts with a discussion about what we are going to be learning and working on, before launching into hands on coding time. Instructors provide guided lessons on the big teaching screens, and kids can follow along, while adding their own personal style to the project.
          .col-md-4
            h4.pad-top Hour 2: OUTDOOR PLAY
            p We believe that the best learning requires giving the brain a break, and including unstructured play time. That's why we include a break after every hour of coding time. We walk the kids over to Hamlin Park (one block north of us) and keep an eye on them while they play, eat snacks and get to know each other better.
          .col-md-4
            h4.pad-top Hour 3: CODING
            p Following the break, we regroup and revisit what our project still needs, and then demonstrate the steps to finish it. Kids that finish their project early may be permitted to work on individual projects.
        h4.pad-top SCHEDULE VARIATIONS
        p Early Coding camp contains a mix of iPad and offline activities inside the coding hours to reinforce concepts and accommodate younger, shorter attention spans. We typically do 2-3 different activities per hour with this group.
        p Middle Schoolers often don't have the same excess energy as the younger kids, so they may need less break time and want more coding time. We adjust the length of each section accordingly.
        p Advanced coders who have worked with us before may focus exclusively on personal projects if they choose. They don't need to follow the group coding lesson, and instead we provide one-on-one coaching and assistance to support them in building larger and more complex projects.
        h2.heading-section.text-center.pad-top FULL DAY CAMPS
        p If you register for Coding and Sports Combo, or combine a morning and afternoon camp in the same week, your day will look like this:
